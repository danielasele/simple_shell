0x16. C - Simple Shell team Project

This project represents the realization of a shell as a significant milestone project within the C programming curriculum at ALX Africa Software Engineering. The Gates of Shell initiative, undertaken during the first trimester, serves as an educational tool to deepen students' comprehension of advanced concepts integral to shell programming. These concepts encompass processes, system calls, bit manipulation, file management, and error handling, among others.

Functioning as a basic UNIX command interpreter, the shell implemented in this project mirrors the functionalities of the simple shell (sh). Notably, the entire program is crafted using the C programming language.
